## What is this?

K-Llama is a **lightweight distributed LLM inference system for heterogeneous edge devices** (a 2026 Beijing Jiaotong University student innovation project). It unifies "who holds which layers, with which engine, where, and at what capacity" into a single abstraction, `(layer_range, engine, location)`, and uses it to run models **layer-by-layer across machines** that cannot hold the whole model.

**Two engine tiers**, chosen by device profile (not "if there is a GPU, use torch"):

| Tier | Engine | Suited to |
|---|---|---|
| **L tier** | llama.cpp / GGUF (including cut GGUF + `embd` injection) | Lightweight, edge, torch-less nodes |
| **D tier** | PyTorch (layer splitting, inter-layer pipeline, multi-node segments) | CUDA PCs; also the platform for cut-point search and experiments |

**Three node kinds are isomorphic** and share one contract plus fail-closed validation: `local` (in-process), `remote_rpc` (borrowed compute over the network — `ggml-rpc-server` on Android/PC), and `cross_framework` (cross-engine layer handoff). The optional Relay R track (cut GGUF + `embd` injection, same-host or cross-host) serves **capacity merging and heterogeneous capability composition**; relay is a capacity mechanism, a same-host CUDA monolith is faster, and default routing prefers the L / RPC paths that can run the model outright (numbers and setup: [README §layer pipeline](../README.md#layer-pipeline-and-cross-framework-layer-relay)).

Design principles: **data stays in-cluster, offline autonomy, reproducible acceptance**.

## Verified capabilities

| Capability | Criterion / date |
|---|---|
| Dual-machine real-device layer pipeline (QW1.8B layers 0-21 / 21-24) | 3× `distributed_required` all passed, RTT 6-12 ms (2026-08-20) |
| Task-graph restart / kill-and-recover + Tailnet IPv6 | `wf_330d0aa1…`, reassignment 0 (2026-08-21) |
| D→L cross-framework relay correctness | Main-repo dual-engine matrix **27/27 per-token identical** (2026-09-21) |
| D→L capacity gain | qwen2.5-0.5B **1.568×** / qwen3-2b **1.547×**; under the same controlled 3.0 GB CUDA budget the whole model is rejected while a 12-layer upstream passes (2026-09-21) |
| L→L keep-head channel | `--path l2l_keep_head` / `d2l2l_keep_head` **32/32**, including the three-stage "1 torch upstream + 2 llama downstream" case (2026-09-21) |
| Pure L→L multi-hop (three stages, all on device) | y700 head8 → y700 mid8-16 → y700 cut-k16 tail, host only sends commands ⇒ **32/32** (2026-09-22) |
| Pure L→L cross-device (three stages) | y700 head8 → **Surface** mid8-16 → y700 tail ⇒ **32/32**, two real machines cooperating with the host doing no compute (2026-09-22) |
| Android layer-segment numerical validation | Real ARM64 (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Android 15) is per-token identical to x86_64; dotprod/i8mm kernels confirmed (2026-09-21/22) |
| Cut-point solver closed loop | `scripts/relay_cut_plan.py` fits segment profiles from measurements, then solves; the two-segment loop passes on qwen2.5 (r² 0.96/0.99) and qwen3.5 (0.79/0.96) |
| Windows native compile path | `triton-windows==3.8.0.post28` verified working; `PYTHONUTF8=1` is a prerequisite |
| Judging-policy fix | multi-model 0/4 → loose+512 becomes discriminative; DS3-0324-7B replaces R1 (v2 policy 2/4×3, format 8/11×3) |
| Sub-project: small-model harness workbench (S1-S8) | context budget / STATE memory / RAG / MCP, local gates |
| Web search / lightweight Fetch (WEB-TOOL G1-G6) | local dev gates, `production_network_enabled=false` |

## Outstanding work

- Cross-host RPC vs relay has not been compared; D→L long-run, cross-host and multi-segment failure acceptance remain.
- A middle stage must share a LAN with its caller: with the middle stage on a cross-network node (Surface through the Tailscale DERP relay, RTT 777 ms) every step costs a round trip, and end-to-end went from ~140 ms median to ~800 ms.
- Production routing admission (`task_dispatch` off), long-running and power-loss recovery, real 443/WSS, IPv6-only installers and real 7B/12B three-node peak memory are in the deferred acceptance queue; local gates and simulations do not count as passes.
- Android is at P0 only (cross-compile/JNI + layer-segment numerical validation); on-device running, RPC worker, disconnection, thermal/power and security evidence are outstanding.
- Tensor parallelism exists only as an out-of-cluster PoC; speculative decoding is an experimental path.
- Relay consistency is judged by per-token argmax only; a divergence is reported as FAIL.

## First-time setup

Prerequisites:

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Python | ≥ 3.10 (3.12 recommended) | Main runtime and tool scripts |
| Node.js + npm | Node ≥ 18 | Product-shell branch only (`qlh-shell`) |
| JDK 17 + Android SDK (API 34+) | — | Only when building Android |
| Tailscale | latest | Distributed mode; most stable when nodes share a LAN |
| Git | — | clone (with submodules) |
| NVIDIA driver + CUDA (optional) | — | D tier / discrete-GPU PC |

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SgfKrc/LEDS_BJTU
cd LEDS_BJTU
python scripts/setup_envs.py --all            # mainline Python environments (no Node by default)
python scripts/setup_envs.py --all --with-node # also configure the product-shell Node source
python scripts/setup_envs.py --only test,tui  # only the named environments
python scripts/setup_envs.py --check          # verify only, no side effects
```

`setup_envs.py` covers the main environment plus `.venv-test` / `.venv-tui` / `.venv-qwen3-sidecar` and others; platform-specific heavy packages such as torch are not installed automatically — the script filters them and prints each environment's install command (for example `--torch-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126`). Re-run `--check` afterwards. Other environments and startup paths: [README Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start).

The default model is chosen by device profile (`DEFAULT_MODEL_BY_TIER` in `src/model_config.py`, consumed by `get_active_model_paths()` in `src/config.py`):

| Device tier | Default model |
|---|---|
| Mobile / edge / ultrabook (shared VRAM ≤ 2 GB) | `<1B`: `qwen3-0.6b` |
| PC with discrete GPU | `~2B`: `qwen3-5-2b` |

The 2B tier peaks at 2.24 GB VRAM in measurement, which does not fit an ultrabook with ≤ 2 GB shared VRAM. Model files are not committed (`models/` is gitignored); acquisition: [README §models and distribution](../README.md#models-and-distribution).

## Engineering culture

- **Evidence first**: every "done" carries test/log/real-device evidence, with criterion and date.
- **Criterion discipline**: consistency is judged by per-token argmax only; divergence is reported as FAIL; records are split into `mainrepo_end_to_end` / `raw_binding_probe` / `capacity_only` and never mixed.
- **Mechanized, not greenwashed**: test channels split into unit/contract/browser/race/simulation/real-device; every fix ships a negative case.
- **Measure before explaining**: performance conclusions first locate the bottleneck (per-segment time / RTT / dispersion).
- **User sovereignty**: model artifacts, keys and knowledge bases belong to the user; offline recovery works.
